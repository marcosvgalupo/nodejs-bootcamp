# What is NodeJS?
Node JS is a JavaScript RunTime built on google's open source v8 JavaScript Engine.

**JavaScript Runtime:** Is a container, enviroment wich a program written in JS can be executed, but outside of any browser.
**V8 Engine:** Is where the JS code will be parsed and executed in NodeJS.

So, in a simpler way, NodeJS is a enviroment that contains an engine able to parse and execute JS code outside of any browser.

# Why and When to use NodeJS?

## NodeJS Pros:
* Single-threaded, based on event driven, non-blocking I/O model
* Perfect for building **fast** and **scalable** data-intensive apps
* JavaScript across the entire **stack**: faster and more efficiente development
* **NPM**: huge library of open-source packages available for everyone for free
* Very active developer community

**stack:** The stack is all the technologies, including frameworks, libraries, languages and other tools used for a project following a logical and functional organization of the tools with a goal in mind. 

## When to use:
* API database behind it(preferably NoSQL)
* Data streaming (such as Youtube or Netflix)
* Real-time chat application (such as iMessage, Whatsapp and Instagram)
* Server-side web application

## When don't use:
* Applications with heavy server-side processing (CPU-intensive)
* Examples:
    - Images manipulation
    - File conversion
    - File compression

This doesn't mean NodeJS is bad, just that it wasn't designed for these use cases.
